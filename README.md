# A collection of automatic cipher decryption programs

This is a collection of some of the cipher decryption programs I wrote for the National Cipher Challenge 2017/2018/2019. They are written in JavaScript as they were orginally used a part of a private website I created for myself and my teammates. As such I have to go through each to make them more readable and that task is still in progress. See below for a list of currently upload programs.

Current Programs:
 - Automatic Monoalphabetic Substitution solver
 - Automatic Vigenere solver
 - Automatic Caesar solver
 - English Fitness Test (Gauges "how english" a text is)
 - Index Of Coincidence

*Please be aware that in the translation of these programs there may be the odd typo. Also that they were intended for use in a larger website so are not guaranteed to work standalone"
